# projectGraph

## first of all

to run the api you need to enter in the backend folder and run *npm install* and *npm start*;
(if you're in windows, you'll need to run *node src/index.js* unless *npm start*)

## then
you get back to the appGraph folder and run *npm install* and *ng serve --open*;

## note
: the app's still development, so, you can run with the inspect of your browser opened.
